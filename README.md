### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Zubair-Shaikh-Sci/Zubair-Shaikh-Sci** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a creative and enthusiastic researcher with four years of research experience, and I submitted my Ph.D. thesis in December 2021. I have explored spacecraft and ground-based data, developed various analytical algorithms and codes to analyze the data, carried out their physical interpretation, and wrote technical reports and research articles. Formulating a scientific research problem is my key strength. Currently, I am studying the morphology and plasma properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and co-rotating interacting regions (CIRs) using in-situ data. We are also investigating how these large-scale structures disturb near-Earth space. Moreover, our group also investigated different types of plasma waves associated with ICMEs or CIRs, especially the AlfvÃ©n wave and its effect on the geomagnetic storm. I wish to learn new skills and methods to explore space science and expand my scientific horizon to become a leader on the global platform.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on to explore the Dymanic evolution and plasma properties of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs), building sofesticated basic codes (MATLAB, Python) for the spacecrafts (e.g., ACE, Wind, PSP, SO, MMS, THEMIS, etc.) data analysis and visualization,  making documents & codes for the common techniques which is used to answer space science questions. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different data analysis & visulisation techniques to address scientific problems, and learning to develop scietific temper in the society to learn together.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the relationship between open science methods and scientific questions. I am also looking for PostDoc position to fulfill my scientific plans and research. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scientific tools and methods used to explore space plasma processes. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about ICME, CIR, Alfven wave, Cosmic Ray Modulation, Geomagnetic Storm, etc.
